Abstract: 
The aim of this study was to examine different machine learning models and explore diverse features to more effectively predict and
promptly detect PRRS outbreaks. We do this based on location, pig movements, pig production parameters, weather information, and
testing/diagnostic data of the farm. This prediction can support more efficient testing and mitigation strategies to reduce PRRS
impact in the swine industry Among the three major farm types (sow, nursery, and finishing). We focus here in finishing farms, which
have the lowest frequency of testing and lowest standards of immunization and biosecurity and could highly benefit of a system that
helps to predict outbreaks and, more importantly, will contribute to reducing the burden for disease transmission through airborne or
other pathways to breeding herds. Thus, this work examines multiple machine learning models for outbreak prediction and early
detection in finishing farms using a combination of diagnostics, production, and pig trade data.
