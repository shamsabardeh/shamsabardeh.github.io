<div style="text-align: justify"> With an extensive background in different levels 
of digital systems (data science, telecommunication systems, and electronic devices), 
I have gained valuable experiences as a member of interdisciplinary teams to help address 
real-world challenges of telecommunication networks and epidemiology. My primary technical 
background is in the field of applied machine learning, data science, telecommunication networks, IoT, 
and risk analysis. I cherish inclusion, support, collaboration, and knowledge sharing as 
the core values in a team.</div> <br />

<div style="text-align: justify"> I've received my master of science in telecommunication engineering with a focus on 
telecommunication networks from Politecnico di Milano. Thanks to their great quality 
of teaching, and by attending 25 different graduate-level courses in optimization, 
mathematical modeling, and telecommunication network, I could gain an extensive 
background. The great quality of research and advising at Politecnico di Milano provided 
me with invaluable experiences.</div> <br />
 
<div style="text-align: justify">In September 2016, I joined the ECE department at the University of California, Davis, and since then I've been 
conducting research in the area of applied machine learning. I've worked for 5 different National 
Science Foundation grants and on projects with industrial collaboration.  </div>
