<div style="text-align: justify"> With an extensive background in different levels 
of digital systems (data science, telecommunication systems, and electronic devices), 
I have gained valuable experiences as a member of interdisciplinary teams to help address 
real-world challenges of telecommunication networks and epidemiology. My primary technical 
background is in the field of applied machine learning, data science, telecommunication networks, IoT, 
and risk analysis. I cherish inclusion, support, collaboration, and knowledge sharing as 
the core values in a team. </div>

I've received my master of science in telecommunication engineering with a focus on telecommunication networks from Politecnico di Milano. Thanks to a great quality of teaching, research, and advising. By taking and auditing about 25 different graduate-level courses in optimization, mathematical modeling, and telecommunication network, I could gain a wide background in the field. In September 2016, I joined the ECE department at the University of California, Davis and since then have been conducting research in the area of applied machine learning. I have worked for 5 different National Science Foundation grants and on projects with industrial collaboration.
